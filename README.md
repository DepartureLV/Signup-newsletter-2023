# Signup-newsletter-2023
(Full Package On Release tab, If you want the most updated npm you can download the above code and install npm by yourself.)
Since Mailchimp's API has changed a lot, This is a 2023 version of the newsletter signup webpage using Node JS, Express, and Mailchimp API following Dr.Angelu Yu's lesson on Udemy which is already outdated.

I also code this to be used easier by combining any required parameter and value to the very first section of the JS which everyone can read the description and follow along to launch Mailchimp's API much faster and with less effort!

just insert your API key, prefix, and ID, and your Mailchimp will be ready to go!

ingredients (npm install): 
1. express
2. mailchimp
3. body-parser

I also change the HTTP method when the user successfully or fails to subscribe to the modern one which is try catch method that is much more concise and easier to understand.

Moreover, I also let the user return to the newsletter signup page from both the success and failure pages.
